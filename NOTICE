This repository contains materials copyrighted by several parties:

* It uses the OHDSI CDM version 5.0 for PostgreSQL, authored
  by Patrick Ryan, and released under the Apache license.

* It uses subset of data from the CMS 2008-2010 Data Entrepreneursâ€™ 
  Synthetic Public Use File (DE-SynPUF), as converted by OHDSI's
  ETL-CMS project, also Apache licensed.

* So that cohorts mentioned in TheBookOfOHDSI could be used,
  it contains a de minimis subset of RxNorm, ICD-9, and SNOMED
  in order to support unmodified data from 10 patients. 

We consider the incorporation of a tiny subset of RxNorm and
SNOMED codes to be "fair use" since: (a) entire hierarchies are
not used, only top-level codes used in the cohort definitions as
associated with only the exact lower-level codes found in the
sample data; (b) the actual usage represents a tiny fraction of
the entire fraction of said vocabularies, (c) the purpose of
their use is to enable testing of tools that could work with
those standards, (d) no other reasonable use of this subset 
could be done due to its unsystematic and incomplete nature.

SNOMED CT is a comprehensive clinical terminology, originally created
by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and, as of April 2007,
owned, maintained, and distributed by the International Health
Terminology Standards Development Organization (IHTSDO), a
not-for-profit association. 

RxNorm, a standardized nomenclature for clinical drugs for humans, is
produced by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). RxNorm is one
of a suite of designated standards for use in U.S. Federal Government
systems for the electronic exchange of clinical health information. 

The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-9-CM) is based on the World Health Organization's
Ninth Revision, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9). The
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) are the U.S. governmental agencies
responsible for overseeing all changes and modifications to the
ICD-9-CM.

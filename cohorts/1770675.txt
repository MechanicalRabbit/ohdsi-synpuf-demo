End Date Strategy
Custom Drug Era Exit Criteria
This strategy creates a drug era from the codes found in the specified concept set. If the index event is found within an era, the cohort end date will use the era's end date. Otherwise, it will use the observation period end date that contains the index event.
Use the era end date of ACE inhibitors1

    allowing 30 days between exposures
    adding 0 days after exposure end

Cohort Collapse Strategy:
Collapse cohort by era with a gap size of 0 days.

# Acute myocardial infarction events

This test case demonstrates the construction of a domain specific
language specific to the generation of OHDSI Cohorts. To get started,
we need to use the *DataKnots* and *LibPQ* packages, we could then
build `sp10` which represents our entire test database.

    using LibPQ, DataKnots, DataKnots4Postgres
    sp10 = DataKnot(LibPQ.Connection(""))

Our first query against `sp10` simply counts the number of people.

    @query sp10 count(person)
    #=>
    ┼────┼
    │ 10 │

# Acute myocardial infarction events

This test case demonstrates the construction of a domain specific
language specific to the generation of OHDSI Cohorts. To get started,
we'll import some boilerplate definitions. This will create the
*DataKnot* called `sp10` that represents our test database.

    include("copybook.jl")

We implement the cohort definition as found in found in `1770674.sql`
that was produced by the JSON found in `1770674.json`, which defines a
cohort for persons experiencing acute myocardial infarction events.

## Concept Set Definitions

There are two concept sets involved, both of them SNOMED-CT codes for
*myocardial infarction*, one of them an older code (1755008) and then a
more current replacement (22298006). These codes are used to construct
a query, `is_myocardial_infarction` that will be `true` when a
`concept` matches one of these codes, or a descendent.

    @define is_myocardial_infarction =
         iscoded("SNOMED", 22298006, 1755008)

There is also a OHDSI specific code that reflects concepts that would
be valid for each `visit_occurrence`. Presumably this is used to
differentiate between regular visits and those that are at a hospital.

    @define is_inpatient_or_er =
         iscoded("Visit", "ERIP", "ER", "IP")

We could test that these concept sets work to see what sort of
concepts match the criteria.

    @query sp10 concept.filter(is_myocardial_infarction).
                  { code => concept_code, name => concept_name }
    #=>
      │ concept                                                     │
      │ code      name                                              │
    ──┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼

The `sp10` sample database is tightly pruned, so these matched
descendents are much smaller than what they would be in a database
having a full vocabulary set.

## Primary Events

This cohort query has an primary event defined as:

> People having any of the following: *a condition occurrence of Acute
> myocardial Infarction* with continuous observation of at least 0 days
> prior and 0 days after event index date, and limit initial events to:
> all events per person.

This query could be seen as listing condition records, coded as a
*myocardial infarction*.

    @query sp10 begin
        condition
        filter(concept.is_myocardial_infarction)
        { person, start_date, end_date }
    end

Beyond this simple filter is the need to link each condition to a
period of continuous health care coverage. In this case, *index date*
is the start of the condition. The `includes` verb is used to filter
possible observation periods for that same person that include the
given index date.

    @query sp10 begin
        condition
        keep(index_date => start_date)
        keep(this_period =>
              person.observation_period.
                 filter(includes(index_date)).
                 is0to1())
        filter(concept.is_myocardial_infarction &&
               exists(this_period))
        { person,
          period_start => this_period.start_date,
          index_date,
          period_end => this_period.end_date }
    end
    #=>
       │ condition                                    │

In the conceptual model, there should be at most one observation period
record for any given date, hence `is0to1()` is used to mark that the
corresponding period is *singular* with respect to each condition
record. Also note that the filter is adjusted to only include
conditions that have a corresponding observation period.

## Inclusion Criteria

This cohort query has a inclusion criteria defined as:

> Having all of the following criteria: *at least 1 occurrences of a
> visit occurrence of Inpatient or ER visit* where event starts between
> all days Before and 0 days After index start date and event ends
> between 0 days Before and all days After index start date.

This criteria can be encoded as a case where the index date is included
within the visit's begin/end period. This serves to further limit the
conditions of interest, exclusing ones that didn't occur within the
context of an ER or inpatient visit.

    @query sp10 begin
        condition
        keep(index_date => start_date)
        keep(acute_visit =>
              person.visit.filter(
                  concept.is_inpatient_or_er &&
                  includes(index_date)))
        filter(concept.is_myocardial_infarction &&
               exists(acute_visit))
        { person,
          visit_start => acute_visit.start_date,
          index_date,
          visit_end => acute_visit.end_date }
    end
    #=>
      │ condition                                   │
      │ person  visit_start  index_date  visit_end  │
    ──┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┼

There is an implicit critiera found in the implementation but not in
the specification, that is, that the visit is also fully contained
within an observation period. Since this same period should be shared
between the visit and the condition, we could write:

    @query sp10 begin
        condition
        keep(index_date => start_date)
        keep(this_period =>
              person.observation_period.
                 filter(includes(index_date)).
                 is0to1())
        keep(acute_visit =>
              person.visit.filter(
                  concept.is_inpatient_or_er &&
                  includes(index_date) &&
                  during(this_period)))
        filter(concept.is_myocardial_infarction &&
               exists(acute_visit))
        { person, index_date }
    end
    #=>
      │ condition          │
      │ person  index_date │
    ──┼────────────────────┼
    1 │ 1780    2008-04-10 │
    2 │ 30091   2009-08-02 │
    3 │ 69985   2010-07-22 │
    4 │ 95538   2009-03-30 │

    6 │ 110862  2009-09-30 │
    =#

Here we use `during`, which is defined like `includes`, only that it
works in reverse. During checks that the start/end of one interval is
fully contained within the other, inclusively. Hence, we want to ensure
that the visit occurs during the observation period.

## Cohort Construction

Finally, the cohort construction is defined as being the above primary
events, that match the inclusion criteria, but with the events being
collapsed so that overlapping events are treated as a single event.

> Limit cohort of initial events to: all events per person. Limit
> qualifying cohort to: all events per person. This cohort defintion
> end date will be the index event's start date plus 7 days. Collapse
> cohort by era with a gap size of 180 days.

    @query sp10 begin
        person.keep(it)
        each(begin
            condition
            keep(index_date => start_date)
            keep(this_period =>
                  person.observation_period.
                     filter(includes(index_date)).
                     is0to1())
            keep(acute_visit =>
                  person.visit.filter(
                      concept.is_inpatient_or_er &&
                      includes(index_date) &&
                      during(this_period)))
            filter(concept.is_myocardial_infarction &&
                   exists(acute_visit))
            date_interval(index_date,
                min(index_date + 7days, this_period.end_date))
            collapse_intervals(180days)
        end)
        myocardial_infarction_cohort =>
            { person,
              cohort_entry => start_date,
              cohort_exit => end_date}
    end
    #=>
      │ myocardial_infarction_cohort      │
      │ person  cohort_entry  cohort_exit │

    =#

This collapsing is done by first creating a date interval, which runs
from the index date, plus 7 days, or the observation period's ending
date, which ever comes first. Once again, limiting to the observation
periods ending date is not in the specification, but its implemented.

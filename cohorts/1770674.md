# Acute myocardial infarction events

This test case demonstrates the construction of a domain specific
language specific to the generation of OHDSI Cohorts. To get started,
we need to use the *DataKnots* and *LibPQ* packages, we could then
build `sp10` which represents our entire test database.

    using LibPQ, DataKnots, DataKnots4Postgres
    sp10 = DataKnot(LibPQ.Connection(""))

We're going to follow the generated SQL found in `1770674.sql` that was
produced by the JSON found in `1770674.json`. This SQL isn't hand
crafted, so our work here shouldn't be compared directly to SQL.
Before we start our translation, let's run our first query.

    @query sp10 count(person)
    #=>
    ┼────┼
    │ 10 │
    =#

OHDSI has it's own concept identifiers, while one could work with
those, it may be more helpful in a query to use concept code as
provided from a given vocabulary. Let's define `SNOMED` to translate
from the `SNOMED` vocabulary to OHDSI's internal concept identifiers.

    SNOMED(id) = @query begin
        concept
        filter((vocabulary_id=="SNOMED") & (concept_code==$id))
        concept_id
        is1to1()
    end

Then we could use SNOMED codes and have them automatically translated.

    @query sp10 $SNOMED("22298006")
    #=>
    │ concept_id │
    ┼────────────┼
    │    4329847 │
    =#
